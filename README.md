## üñºÔ∏è How to Change Pinterest Pictures on the Website

If you want to update the Pinterest images displayed on the website, **you don‚Äôt need to know how to code** ‚Äî just follow these steps:

### ‚úÖ Steps to Update Pinterest Pictures

1. **Go to the file**  
   [Click here to open the `PinterestGallery.js` file on GitHub](https://github.com/AkaiMoveisPlanejados/akai-website/blob/main/src/app/components/PinterestGallery/PinterestGallery.js)  
   *(Make sure you're signed in with a GitHub account that has access to the repository.)*

2. **Find the list of images**  
   You'll see a list like this:

   ```js
   const projects = [
     {
       imgSrc: "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/....jpg",
       pinterestUrl: "https://pin.it/xxxxxxx",
     },
     // more items...
   ];
Edit the file
Click the ‚úèÔ∏è pencil icon at the top right of the file to start editing.

Replace the image URLs

imgSrc: the direct image link from Pinterest.

pinterestUrl: the Pinterest page URL (the pin itself).

Example:

```js
{
  imgSrc: "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/new-image.jpg",
  pinterestUrl: "https://pin.it/newPinId",
}
```
## Commit the changes
Scroll to the bottom of the page, write a short message like Updated Pinterest images, and click Commit changes.

üìå Notes
You can add more image blocks by copying an existing one and updating the URLs.

Always include both imgSrc and pinterestUrl for each image.
